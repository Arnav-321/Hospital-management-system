Hospital Management System – Homepage (LifeCare Multispeciality Hospital)

This project is a Hospital Management System homepage designed using HTML and CSS. It represents a realistic hospital website interface that includes hospital branding, navigation menus, service information, doctor profiles with photos, and contact details. The homepage acts as the front-end representation of a hospital management system and provides users with clear information about hospital facilities and medical staff.

The main objective of this project is to design a professional hospital homepage, understand webpage layout using HTML and CSS, implement menu-based navigation, display doctor profiles in a structured format, and create a realistic user interface suitable for academic projects.

The system includes the following features: a navigation bar with smooth scrolling, hospital logo and banner section, about hospital section, hospital services listing, doctor profiles with photos and specializations, contact information section, and a clean grid-based layout for better user experience.

The technologies used in this project are HTML5 and CSS3. The project can be executed on any modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Mozilla Firefox.

The project structure consists of an index.html file containing the complete homepage design and a README file describing the project details.

To run the project, download or copy the project files, open the project folder, and double-click the index.html file. The hospital homepage will open automatically in the default web browser.

The output of this project is a fully functional hospital homepage that displays navigation menus such as Home, About, Services, Doctors, and Contact. It also presents doctor profiles with images and hospital information in a professional layout.

This project can be used for college mini-projects, web technology lab records, frontend design demonstrations, and HTML/CSS practice for beginners.

Future enhancements of this project may include login functionality for admin, doctor, and patient roles, online appointment booking system, backend integration using Java or Python, database connectivity using SQL, and an admin dashboard for managing hospital operations.

This project is developed by Arnav Kumar, Computer Science Engineering (CSE), and is intended strictly for educational purposes.
